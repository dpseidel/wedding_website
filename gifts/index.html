<p>Please know your participation in our memory quilt and your love and support in the past,
present and future are huge gifts unto themselves and we are lucky enough to already have nearly everything we need for this new chapter together!</p>
<p>However, for friends and family who have inquired about gift ideas, we’ve created
a universal online registry at <a href="https://www.myregistry.com/wedding-registry/dana-seidel-and-owen-warner-alameda-ca/2603226">myregistry.com</a>. Click through the image below

<h2 id="cash-gifts">Cash Gifts</h2>
<p>We are also exceedingly grateful for cash gifts that help inch us closer to
certain dreams. If you would like to support us in any of these below,
<strong>each image will link you to a paypal link that will securely transfer your gift</strong>
without the additional fees leveraged by myregistry.com on cash gifts.</p>
<h4 id="honeymoon-in-australia-2022">Honeymoon in Australia 2022</h4>
<p><a href="https://paypal.me/DanaSeidel?locale.x=en_US"><img src="/./gifts_files/melbourne.jpeg" alt="" title="Send us on a dream honeymoon!"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long been a dream of ours to travel to Australia for the Australian Open,
hosted every January in Melbourne. The dream was pushed back in 2020 and of course
a no-go this year during the pandemic, but it&rsquo;s naturally our dream honeymoon for
when we can all travel again. We look forward to making a real trip out of it: exploring
Melbourne and the tournament grounds during early play, escaping to wine country
and hopefully a stay at the <a href="https://lakehouse.com.au/">Lake House in Daylesford</a>,
a 4-star hotel, restuarant &amp; spa that Dana can&rsquo;t stop oggling. Additionally if time
allows, we&rsquo;d love to travel to Sydney to explore another corner of the world and possibly
Cairns, to catch a glimpse of the Great Barrier Reef before it&rsquo;s too late. We would be ever so
grateful for anyone who wants to help us make this dream honeymoon a reality!</p>
<h4 id="our-dream-home">Our Dream Home</h4>
<p><a href="https://paypal.me/DanaSeidel?locale.x=en_US"><img src="/./gifts_files/home.jpg" alt="" title="Help us buy our home!"></a></p>
<p>While we love our little apartment in Alameda, we are diligently saving our
pennies to be able to afford our own home. Dana looks forward to a proper guest room
and more space for her sewing, Owen longs for a garage and a private yard. We both
look forward to having space add to our family with a pet or two. The goal is to
be able to house hunt in earnest this spring and purchase a house of our own by
summer or early fall 2021. We would be so honored by anyone who chose to help us
with this endeavor as their wedding gift to us.</p>
<h4 id="danas-dream-sewing-machine">Dana&rsquo;s Dream Sewing Machine</h4>
<p><a href="https://paypal.me/DanaSeidel?locale.x=en_US"><img src="/./gifts_files/mc6700p-main.jpg" alt="" title="Be a part of this quilty goodness!"></a></p>
<p>Dana finally has a hobby! After commissioning a quilt from a friend in the quilting
business last fall, Dana began quilting on her own and has really fallen in love! In 2020,
she finished 9 projects including 2 throw sized quilts she sent out for long arming.
She currently sews on a BrotherCS6000i, a popular beginner machine that has been
great for her as she learned to quilt this year. However now that she is a more
advanced quilter and looking to be able to quilt larger projects on her own,
she is dreaming about getting a more serious machine with a larger workspace and
suite of features to help her hone her craft. Unfortunately, these models
will cost upwards of 1500 dollars and with other large purchases
on the horizon (house, wedding, &hellip;), this dream has been put on the backburner for now.
If you&rsquo;d like to support Dana&rsquo;s craft, she would be delighted and forever grateful!</p>
