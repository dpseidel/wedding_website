                    <p>On the 4th of December, socially distanced on the Seidel&rsquo;s back deck in San Jose, CA,
we got married in a virtual civil ceremony with the Alameda County clerk. We are thrilled
to mark this new stage of our relationship but knew we had to find creative ways to
include our loved ones near and far.</p>
<p>We put together this website to introduce each other to you all, our dearest family
and friends, and share a little bit of our joy and plans for the future. While our
ceremony is formally done, we plan to host a housewarming/anniversary party
when it is safe to do so (and we have a house to host in!). Regardless, we look forward to
many chances to celebrate with each of you over the course of what we hope is our long and
happy marriage.</p>
<p>Read below for our story, pictures from our small nuptials, and information on
<a href="guestbook">how to sign our &ldquo;guestbook&rdquo;</a> that was sent out with the wedding announcement.</p>

<h3 id="meet-dana">Meet Dana</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full name:</strong> Dana Paige Seidel
<em>(Note: Dana will be keeping her name)</em></li>
<li><strong>One word to describe:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ebullient">Ebullient</a></li>
<li><strong>Best thing Owen&rsquo;s taught her so far:</strong> The Warner family pastime, Up &amp; Down</li>
<li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I have a twin sister &amp; PhD in Environmental Science!</li>
<li><strong>Natural State:</strong> Dreaming of wonderful futures</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="the-story-as-told-by-dana">The story, as told by Dana:</h5>
<p>My friend Juliet once told me that it was &ldquo;both suprising and so natural&rdquo; to see
Owen and I together. Surprising because we are such different people on the surface,
but so natural how we fit together when you look a little deeper. Maybe that&rsquo;s why it took us sometime ourselves to see that we should be together.</p>
<p>We first met at a birthday party for a mutual friend, Stacey, Owen&rsquo;s roommate at the time,
in July 2017. I spent most of the afternoon thinking Owen was actually Stacey&rsquo;s
husband and not minding for a minute that he listen in while I jabbered about
dating horror stories with my girlfriends. Once set straight, I must have thought
he was cute and interesting because I promptly sent Stacey a message&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="images/stacey_message.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On Owen, I made an impression (as I am want to do) but perhaps not one as alluring as I had hoped &hellip; it took us another year (almost to the date!) and another one of Stacey&rsquo;s
birthday parties for him to figure out that we should be dating.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="meet-owen">Meet Owen</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full name:</strong> Owen Lee Warner</li>
<li><strong>One word to describe:</strong> Strong-willed</li>
<li><strong>Best perk of marrying Dana:</strong> Endless homemade bread</li>
<li><strong>Favorite date night:</strong> Trying new beers at a local brewery</li>
<li><strong>Natural state:</strong> Firmly rooted in the present</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-story-as-told-by-owen">The story, as told by Owen:</h4>
<p>It certainly took me a while to realize that Dana is the person who I should be dating!  But luckily I joined her bookclub and our monthly meetings gave us time to become friends and get to know each other beyond the first impressions.  Luckily for me, Dana&rsquo;s hints stopped being so subtle after a while and once we were together, it was clear to both of us the match was perfect!</p>
<p>Dana&rsquo;s outlook helps me to envision a myriad of future goals together. I am blessed to have her as my partner for the many adventures to come!</p>

                    <p>On December 4, 2020, we joined our parents in an outdoor, socially distanced ceremony
on Peggy &amp; Glen Seidel&rsquo;s back deck in Evergreen, CA. Other immediate family joined
virtually and we had a brief but sweet ceremony with an enthusiastic county clerk
over MSTeams. We exchanged rings and handwritten vows.</p>

                    <p>While we are overjoyed to have the opportunity to get married this year, it was bittersweet to
do so without all of our family and friends joining for the occassion. In a creative bid to include
all those who missed out, Dana is creating a custom guestbook quilt, <a href="https://homemadeemilyjane.com/how-to-make-a-signature-memory-quilt/">inspired by
a fellow quilter</a>.</p>
<p>Along with our holiday cards, we sent out 5&rdquo; fabric squares for our loved ones to sign
and return to us to form the basis of our guestbook quilt. For more instructions on how
to sign the quilt squares, or to follow along for progress on the project, please
see the <a href="guestbook/">Guestbook</a> page.</p>
