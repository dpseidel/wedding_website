        <p>When we realized we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to host our family and friends, we still
wanted to find a way to include everyone in our celebration and create a guestbook of sorts to memorialize this occasion and all the people who love and celebrate with us. And so began the great distributed craft project of Winter 2020, inspired by <a href="https://homemadeemilyjane.com/how-to-make-a-signature-memory-quilt/">Homemade Emily Jane - How to make a signature memory quilt.</a></p>
<p>If you have found this page, you probably received a little package from us this
December, including our holiday card, a white cotton square, a fabric pen and a card
with instructions that read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2020 has been anything but normal. Fittingly, in lieu of a tradiationl guestbook,
Dana is making a memory quilt and hopes to include all of our loved ones with whom we couldn&rsquo;t
share our special day in person! Enclosed is a white cotton square and a fabric pen.
Please write us a note, piece of advice, or just your signagure for our guestbook quilt.
Be sure to write in the center of the sqaure and leave 1&rdquo; from all sides to allow
for trimming and sewing. Once signed, just slipe your square into the return envelope
and mail it back to us; the pen is yours to keep! You can find more information
about our wedding and this memory quilt project at DanaAndOwen.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If these instructions seem a little fuzzy or confusing, never fear! In the
following steps and pictures, I&rsquo;m going to give you a little demo of how I will
turn your signature square into a beautiful quilt block which should hopefully help
resolve any lingering confusion. And if you feel you&rsquo;ve messed up or you&rsquo;d like
another block to sign just shoot us an email, cotton squares are easy to mail (just
hold on to that pesky fabric pen!)</p>
<h5 id="step-by-step-turning-your-square-into-a-quilt-block">Step by Step: Turning your square into a quilt block!</h5>
<p><img src="/./images/quilted_guestbook/step1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So when it arrived - your quilt block should have looked like this - neatly folded
in a little bit of protective plastic - hold on to that! Once you are done signing
you can slip it back in there to give it a little added protection on it&rsquo;s way back to me.</p>
<p>So first thing to do is to pull it out and sign it. <strong>Please be careful to sign at least
half an inch away from the side of the block</strong>. You were sent a 5&rdquo; square block but all my
pattern calls for is a 4.5&rdquo; square. I will be trimming your block AND sewing with a quarter
inch seam allowance.</p>
<p><img src="/./images/quilted_guestbook/step2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A note on the pens:</strong> Everyone was sent either a blue pen OR a green pen.
I scored a great deal on Black Friday to get these pens at a steep discount but
there turned out to be slight differences between the two.</p>
<ul>
<li>The blue pens have a larger brush tip and the ink flows faster. These can be easier to sign with naturally but if you write slowly they can bleed a little.</li>
<li>The green pens are finer tipped and work a little better for writing in small print
and shading. But since they have a drier tip, You may find that you need to retrace your words or lettering to make them stand out.</li>
</ul>
<p>No worries with either, I have plenty extra at home to help touch up any squares that need it
and imperfections are what are going to make this quilt extra special!</p>
<hr>
<p>Back to trimming! It&rsquo;s more important to leave me space to trim and sew than to be centered,
since as you can see in the next picture, I can trim your block center if given the necessary
space!</p>
<p><img src="/./images/quilted_guestbook/step3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This 4.5&rdquo; CreativeGrids ruler is my very best friend for this part!</p>
<p><img src="/./images/quilted_guestbook/step4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, each of the trimmed 4.5&rdquo; squares will be the center of what&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;sawtooth star&rdquo;.
After sewing with a .25&rdquo; seam the center will be exactly 4&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t sew this square
but have laid it over a previous example to demonstrate the size difference.</p>
<p><img src="/./images/quilted_guestbook/step5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example where I have scribbled in the seam allowance for clarity.
If I sew it right, none of that black edge will ever show in the final block.</p>
<p><img src="/./images/quilted_guestbook/step5b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead I will end up with ~55 beautiful crisp sawtooth stars with sweet messages
from all of you!</p>
<p><img src="/./images/quilted_guestbook/final.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t finalized our fabric choices just yet but wouldn&rsquo;t this sweet bundle from
Cottoneer Fabrics be just perfect?!?</p>
